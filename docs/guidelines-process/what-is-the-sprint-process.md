# What is the Sprint Planning Process

## Background Context

***

    * FSD is Functional Specification Document.

## Steps

***

### Backlog Grooming

    * once at the end of each sprint


    1. Product Team prepares FSD
    2. EM check if FSD is complete

        * non functional (prepared by EM)

            * storage, network, performance, security, availability, reliability, cost etc.


        * functional (prepared by Product)

            * user requirements

    3. EM to verify if system design requirement is needed.

        * if need design then we need more time to design RFC (depends on scope)


    4. EM to discuss with devs on system design for each FSD and subtasks.

    5. EM to decide sprint point with other developers during backlog grooming session (2-3 hours).

    6. EM to discuss with team on how much capacity we have for next sprint total.


### Sprint Planning

    5. Sprint planning with product: EM with Product meet to decide which tickets to bring into sprint.
    6. Sprint planning with team: EM with Team to assign tasks.


### Sprint Development

    6. Dev should only have 1 ticket in progress at a time.
    7. 2nd week of sprint is reserved for development - meetings kept to a minimal.
    8. Start of 3rd week dev tasks should be completed and hand over to QA.


### Sprint Changes

    9. Any new adhoc tickets will assign to EM to see if need to change the Sprint deliverables.
